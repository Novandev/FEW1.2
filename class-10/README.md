# FEW 1.2 Phaser

Phaser is a library for making games in JS. 

Phaser is pretty sophisticated it takes all of the objects you migth have created in the break out game, expands on them. 
Pahser uses canvas to render objects to the screen. Pahser breaks all of the common tasks into classes that cna be reused. 

## Getting started

### The local server and CORS

Before getting started we need to understand web browsers, security, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). 
CORS is an issue you will run into often working with JavaScript as your applications get more complex. 
In short the browser puts limits to what files can be accessed via JavaScript in the browser. 

To test Phaser locally you'll need to run a local server. Follow the guide here:

### Phaser Tutorial

### MDN Breakout with Phaser

As an alternative to the Phaser Tutorial above you can work on this tutorial which creates a Breakout game with Phaser. This is an easier project that still uses Phaser. 

If you were interested in the physics and collisions in the first tutorial this term this one improves on those using Phaser. The Phaser library includes a full Physics engine. 

This tutorial also shows what it looks like when you break code into Objects. Imagine you kept developing those objects from the first assignment, this project would be the project from the future, after having been developed to a high degree.

## Challenges 

**Challenge 1**: Get your local server running

Choose your favorite method from the [Getting started with Phaser](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3) section. Make sure you can run the server when needed. Take some notes, you'll need to launch your server every time you work on your project. 

**Challenge 2**: Complete the tutorial. 

This tutorial is involved and has a lot new ideas. Take notes along the way. There are lot of new concepts here. 
you'll want to revisit these ideas after you have completed the tutorial. 

## Stretch Challenges 

**Stretch Challenge 1**: If you have completed the tutorial try changing the artwork. 
This is a good start to learning how the system works. Check out these resources or make your own.
